As a part of Milestone Project 1 to demonstrate an understanding of user-centric Front-End Development, I have designed and deployed this website for a local public group for the Marathi Society residing in Wales.

+ #### Future Implementations

	* Add FAQ section under contacts.
	* Add Javascript to add collapsible event categories on the Gallery page.
	* Use Javascript to implement a thank you page redirect and return values to an email address.
	* Change Image formats to WebP.
	* Better understand image formats so the pages load quicker and Lighthouse results are most optimised.
- ### Scope
	* Due to constraints of using HTML5 and CSS3, only ensure a simple but accessible layout.
	* The website to be static yet responsive to be available to be accessed on various devices.
	* Continuity is maintained thourghout all pages for better user experience.
	* Navigation links to be made available on all pages for ease.
	* Ensure the website does not exceed more than 5 pages.
	* Due to short time constraint ensure similar structure throughout all pages.
- ### Structure
	* A default home-page that navigates all the pages and provides relevant information about the institution.
	* Categorise pages based on the variety of content that is to be made available to users, as if it were a table of content.
	* Ensure a portal is made available for contact to be made with the administration without having to open another mail agent.

- ### Surface
	+ #### Colour Scheme
		* I have used a saffron/rufous palette which is consistent with the cultural representation of the website users and company.
		* Black and red-orange font color plays a good contrast to the chosen colour palette.

		![Colour Scheme][def]

	+ #### Typography
		* The Samarkan font is representative of the Marathi Devnagri script therefore this font was chosen for the logo  text. As this was not available on Google Fonts library, Cdnfonts has been used to import Samarkan font into style.css.
		![samarkan][def43]
		* Google Fonts has been used to import Karma and Playfair fonts into style.css. These have been chosen as they are readable in all font weights and have a simple and modern feel. These fonts also match the mandala hero images used well due to their angled edges.
		**Karma**
		![karma][def45]
		**Playfair**
		![playfair][def44]
	+ #### Imagery
		![heroimage][def46]
		* The chosen Hero image for backgrounds all pages is consistent with the feel of an Indian origin society due to the Mandala patterns.
		* These images have been chosen due to their large clear space of two-thirds area of the image while flaunting a Mandala design on one-third area. The clear space makes all the text aganist it readable while the Mandala design adds aesthetics.
		![footerimage][def48]
		* The Image chosen for footer has a skyline of Mumbai, which is the capital city of Maharashtra. This skyline is set on a saffron background which is consistent to the colour scheme.		
		* ![favicon][def49] The favicon was designed using an online favicon generator. This has been designed with a saffron background with the initials of the organisation 'WMS'
		* All the images used are license free or been used with owners consent. The sources are listed in the Credits section.
		* Images used were compressed using tinyfy tool on the first instance, however, this did not suffice (as reflected in lighthouse testing) Therefore Shrink.media online tool was used to futher compress for better performance and user experience.
